            <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">My name is NAVEED CHAGANI. I currently work at a Credit Union. I have more than 5 years’ experience working in the financial sector. I inspire to become a software developer. I have been learning coding for some time now and the more I learn it the more I fell in love with it. It is a passion for me now and I want to peruse it as a career. I want to be the best at what I do, and I pride myself in it. I am a hard worker whatever I decide to do I work very hard to archive it.</p>

            <p class="alignment">My name is NAVEED CHAGANI. I currently work at a Credit Union. I have more than 5 years’ experience working in the financial sector. I inspire to become a software developer. I have been learning coding for some time now and the more I learn it the more I fell in love with it. It is a passion for me now and I want to peruse it as a career. I want to be the best at what I do, and I pride myself in it. I am a hard worker whatever I decide to do I work very hard to archive it.</p>
